' '.join(lst):

Purpose: This converts the list of words (lst) back into a single string, where each word is separated by a space (' ').
How it works:
The join() method concatenates all elements of the list (lst) into a single string.
The string ' ' specifies the separator between elements. In this case, it uses a space to join the words.
