' '.join(lst):

Purpose: This converts the list of words (lst) back into a single string, where each word is separated by a space (' ').
How it works:
The join() method concatenates all elements of the list (lst) into a single string.
The string ' ' specifies the separator between elements. In this case, it uses a space to join the words.

#Saving Data (json.dump()):
json.dump() is used to serialize the Python dictionary (employee_data) and write it to the specified file (employee_data.json).
indent=4: This adds indentation to the JSON file for readability (pretty-printing).

try:
        with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            json.dump(data, file, indent=4)  # indent=4 for pretty formatting
        print(f"Data saved successfully to '{file_path}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while saving data to the JSON file: {e}")

#Loading Data (json.load()):
json.load() reads the JSON file and converts it back into a Python dictionary.
with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            data = json.load(file)  # Load the JSON data
        print(f"Data loaded successfully from '{file_path}'.")
        return data
